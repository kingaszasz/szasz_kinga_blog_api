Computers are about as common\nas screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them\ndo the things you want them to do isn’t always easy.\nIf the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one,\nsuch as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the\nappropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks,\nthere may not be an application.\nThat is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructing\na program—a set of precise instructions that tell a computer what to\ndo. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally\ntedious and frustrating.\nFortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor\nof thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with, programming can be\nvery rewarding. It allows you to do things that would take forever by hand, in\nseconds. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn’t do\nbefore. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.\nMost programming is done with programming languages. A programming\nlanguage is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers. It\nis interesting that the most effective way we’ve found to communicate with a\ncomputer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other.\nLike human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be\ncombined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.","tag":"JS,  JavaSript","created":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 17:52","updated":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 17:52"}]
