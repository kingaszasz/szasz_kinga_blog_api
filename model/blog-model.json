[{"id":1,"title":"JavaScrpt introduction","content":"This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common\nas screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them\ndo the things you want them to do isn’t always easy.\nIf the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one,\nsuch as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the\nappropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks,\nthere may not be an application.\nThat is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructing\na program—a set of precise instructions that tell a computer what to\ndo. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally\ntedious and frustrating.\nFortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor\nof thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with, programming can be\nvery rewarding. It allows you to do things that would take forever by hand, in\nseconds. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn’t do\nbefore. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.\nMost programming is done with programming languages. A programming\nlanguage is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers. It\nis interesting that the most effective way we’ve found to communicate with a\ncomputer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other.\nLike human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be\ncombined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.","tag":"JS,  JavaSript","comments":[],"created":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:7","updated":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:7"},{"id":2,"title":"Lorem history","content":"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.","tag":"lorem","comments":["I like it, thanx","this is fantastic","oh, grate","wtf"],"created":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:8","updated":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:18"},{"id":3,"title":"Lorem history 2","content":"t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).","tag":"lorem","comments":[],"created":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:9","updated":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:9"},{"id":4,"title":"Lorem history 3","content":"There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.","tag":"lorem","comments":[],"created":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:9","updated":"2018-4-16\n    Idő: 19:9"}]
